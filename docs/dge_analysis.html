Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility.
</p>
<p>
The results in this page were generated with repository version <a href="https://github.com/DRMCRL/PDX_Gar15-13_Veh_DHT_Sarm_RNASeq/tree/d4045cb5c0c4e74decdd5c22d8b5be31cd8ce892" target="_blank">d4045cb</a>. See the <em>Past versions</em> tab to see a history of the changes made to the R Markdown and HTML files.
</p>
<p>
Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:
</p>
<pre><code>
Ignored files:
    Ignored:    .Rhistory
    Ignored:    .Rproj.user/
    Ignored:    PDX_Gar15-13_Veh_DHT_Sarm_RNASeq.Rproj

Untracked files:

Note that any generated files, e.g. HTML, png, CSS, etc., are not included in this status report because it is ok for generated content to have uncommitted changes.

<p>PCA after removal of undetectable genes showed that samples group well by treatment. PC1 appears to capture the treatment effects, whilst the technical variation betwene replicates is found on PC2 and PC3. In terms of the amount of variability within the dataset, PC2 was comparable to PC1 indicating that there is a high degree of inter-replicate variability.</p>
</div>
<div id="checks-for-gc-and-length-bias" class="section level2">
<h2>Checks for GC and Length bias</h2>
<p>The impact of GC content or length bias was assessed as a possible source of technical variation.</p>
<p>Genes were divided in 10 approximately equal sized bins based on increasing length, and 10 approximately equal sized bins based on increasing GC content, with the final GC/Length bins being the combination 100 bins using both sets. The contribution of each gene to PC1 and PC2 was assessed and a t-test performed on each bin. This tests</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: \mu = 0 \text{ against } H_A: \mu \neq 0
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> represents the true contribution to PC1 of all genes in that bin.</p>
<p>If any bin makes a contribution to PC1 the mean will be clearly non-zero, whilst if there is no contribution the mean will be near zero. In this way, the impact of gene length and GC content on variance within the dataset can be assessed. As seen below, the contribution of GC content and gene length to PC1 is very clear, with a smaller contribution being evident across PC2. As a result, Conditional Quantile Normalisation (<code>CQN</code>) is recommended in preference to the more common TMM normalisation.</p>

<h2>Main Results</h2>
<p>A design matrix was formed giving each replicate it’s own baseline and the common DHT response was then specified as the final column. Following this, dispersions were estimated for the main <code>DGEList</code> object and the model fitted using the Quasi-likelihood GLM.</p>

<p>In order to detect genes which respond to DHT the Null Hypothesis (<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>) was specified to be a range around zero, instead of the conventional point-value.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
H_0: -\lambda \leq \mu \leq \lambda \\
\text{Vs.} \\
H_A: |\mu| &gt; \lambda
\]</span></p>
<p>This characterises <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> as being a range instead of being the singularity 0, with <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> representing the true mean logFC.</p>
<p>The default value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \log_2 1.2 = 0.263\)</span> was chosen. This removes any requirement for <em>post hoc</em> filtering based on logFC. Using this approach, 2216 genes were considered as DE to an FDR of 0.05. Of these, 1109 were up-regulated with the remaining 1107 being down-regulated.</p>
